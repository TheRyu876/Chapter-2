 A dark purple light engulfed Ryu’s sight and body, swallowing him completely.

  <br>
  <br>

 This feeling… I want to—

  <br>
  <br>

 Ryu immediately clamped his hand over his mouth.

  <br>
  <br>

 It was as if his entire existence was being hurled through space, twisting and churning—he felt like vomiting.
 
  <br>
  <br>
  
 The sensation lasted no more than ten seconds, but to Ryu, it felt like an eternity. Then the light vanished—and with it, the urge to vomit disappeared.
 
  <br>
  <br>
  
 No... not vanished. It had merely been replaced—by something worse.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Suffocation.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 “!!”
 
  <br>
  <br>
  
 Panic surged through him. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t move properly.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 What is this?! Water?!

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He struggled to see. His eyes were open, yet the world remained pitch black. Only suffocation. Only stillness.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Hesitantly, he parted his lips just enough to taste the liquid surrounding him.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 It’s warm… tastes fresh, but bitter… A lake.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 It made no sense. Moments ago, he had died in a snowy wasteland. Then he woke in a strange, endless land of dirt and mountains. And now—he was underwater?

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Then he noticed something odd on his ankle. A sensation of metal, tight but not enough to cut circulation.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 What the hell is this…? No, I don’t have time for this...

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He had to swim up—but which way was “up”?

  <br>
  <br>
  
 I don’t have much breath left… God, can’t I just die in peace?!

  <br>
  <br>
  
 And then, an idea struck him.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He would swim in different directions. If his lungs felt more pressure in one way, that meant he was going deeper—and he would reverse it.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Let’s try this direction…

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He pushed forward. Nothing.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He reversed. Still nothing.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Sideways, maybe? he cursed in his mind.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He shifted to another direction. This time, the pressure increased.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 This way… it’s down. Reverse…

  <br>
  <br>
  
 His breath was nearly gone. Pain clawed at his lungs, his mind spinning from the lack of oxygen.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Just… a little more.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He didn’t care about dying. He had already accepted death before.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 But something inside him still resisted. Still fought.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Because more than death—he hated the idea of giving up.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 With one final push, he broke the surface, gasping. His lungs ached. His head pounded.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 “Where… am I…?” he panted.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Though he had surfaced, he could see very little—only a few stars and the dim shimmer of a cloud-obscured moon.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Then he remembered.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 The metal around my ankle…

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He reached down with shaky hands to feel it—and what he discovered sent chills down his spine.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 An iron shackle.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 And worse—

  <br>
  <br>
  
 “Chains…!”

  <br>
  <br>
  
 No sooner had the word left his lips than the chains began to stir.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He could feel it—the pull building.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Without a second thought, Ryu drew in a deep breath.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 His fears were confirmed.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 The chains yanked him beneath the surface with brutal force.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Ryu struggled to maintain a sense of direction, but it was useless. The chains dragged him violently, pulling him through twisting paths underwater.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Then—

  <br>
  <br>
  
 His body slammed into dirt.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Pain shot through him.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 No broken bones, he quickly assessed. Small mercy. The last thing he needed now was an injury.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He continued to be dragged across the lakebed for several meters before the pull weakened. The chains still twitched now and then—but not enough to move him further.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Whatever’s on the other end of this chain… I don’t want to know. I don’t want to meet it.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 The strength of the earlier pull told him enough. Whatever it was, it wasn’t human.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 I need to get rid of it… these chains.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He sighed silently, still trying to wrap his head around the surreal horror he’d landed in.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 I can’t risk attracting that thing.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He looked around. The moon was up, but cloaked by heavy clouds—explaining the faint light.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 “It’s a lake, alright… a big one.”

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He wasn’t an expert, but judging by the distance to the shore and the lack of visible boundaries, he estimated the lake stretched at least 10,000 square kilometers.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 The fact that it dragged me from that far away in under a minute…

  <br>
  <br>
  
 The thought chilled him to his core.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He glanced toward the treeline—dense, tall trees clustered tightly together.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 A forest. A thick one…

  <br>
  <br>
  
 He almost laughed—more out of dread than amusement.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 What’s waiting for me at the end of this chain? This can’t get any worse.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 And then, as if the world had heard him—mocked him—

  <br>
  <br>
  
 The chain jerked.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Ryu stumbled, falling face-first onto the ground.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Then it began to pull him again.

  <br>
  <br>
  
 Toward the forest.
